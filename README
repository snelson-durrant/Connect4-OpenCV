This is code I wrote to enable an arduino robot arm to autonomously play a human opponent in Connect 4. There are four parts:
    (1) connect4ai.py - runs analysis on the board state and determines the robot's moves
    (2) connect4opencv.py - reads in a processable array from a video stream of the physical board
    (3) connect4robot.py - sets up connections and communicates with the arduino over bluetooth
    (4) connect4arduino.ino - recieves bluetooth signals and directs servo movements

The ai is written using a minimax algorithm (starting at the middle column of the board and working outwards) with alpha-beta pruning. Each game board is scored based on wins, combinations of three pieces and an open space, combinations of two pieces and two open spaces, combinations of one piece and three open spaces, and controlling the center columns. The OpenCV computer vision uses a hough circle algorithm to identify the board grid layout and red and yellow masks to determine the position of each piece.
